## My Python Journey

Python is a high level cross-platform programming language that is incredibly efficient...your programs can do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. 
The syntax will also help you write "clean code" i.e. easy to read, easy to debug and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.
Python is also used for many purposes such as building games, web applications, AI and machine learning systems etc. It is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.

As part of the ALX SE program, I'll be learning python in the second sprint and this repo will document my journey through this programming model. It will contain everything from the basics to mini projetcs. I intend to develop medium to high-level proficiency in this language as I pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
