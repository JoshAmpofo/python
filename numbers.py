# Exercise
# Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication,
# and division operations that each result in the number 8
# Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements
# to see the results. You should create four lines that 
# look like this:
    # print(5 + 3)
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number
# 8 appearing once on each line
 
add_num = print(5 + 3)
sub_num = print(12 - 4)
mult_num = print(4 * 2)
div_num = print(16 / 2)

# Favorite number: Store your favorite number in a variable.
# Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals
# your favorite number. Print that message

fav_num = 5792
message = f"My favorite number is {fav_num:,}"
print(message)
